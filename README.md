# 📝 NotesApp

A fullstack Notes application built with React (Vite) frontend and Express + MongoDB backend.

##  How to run:

1. Clone the repository 
2. Within the backend folder, set up .env file based on the .env.example file
3. Since this is a monorepo, you don't need to run npm install in both frontend and backend separately.
   Just run-
   
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run start
